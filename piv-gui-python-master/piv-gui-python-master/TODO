# things todo for piv_gui

+enable plotting vectors on demand

+option for non-square IWs

+avoid the need to match the raw/flow_field image sizes?

+functionalize the load button to choose the directory of the images.

+obtain IW/overlap values automatically to whatever IW/overlap sizes were set in the analysis.

+enable zooming

+check if moving_sub_window_arrays function is "compatible" with extended_search in openpiv

+check if "first"/"second" frame are consistent with openpiv definition.

+improve variable names?

+test if the dynamic range of the big/small IWs are the same. (Currently image is set cmax = 255, cmin = 0, which seems to work)

+improve the scalability of the GUI (automate scaling of IWs to something reasonable)

+implement this GUI to the openpiv GUI
